In this practical, you will use C to write code that flashes all eight LEDs in a pattern based on the mode corresponding to the respective button press, which changes at an interval defined by your timer settings. You will also enable one of your push buttons to alternate the delay timing

# EEE3096S_LAB2
This practical demonstrates controlling LEDs and reading pushbuttons on an STM32 microcontroller using ARM Assembly. The implementation includes incrementing LED patterns at specified intervals, adjusting the increment and delay based on button inputs, setting a fixed LED pattern, and freezing the display. The tasks emphasize low-level hardware interfacing, use of time delay loops, and conditional branching in Assembly. The practical showcases direct manipulation of GPIO and highlights core skills in embedded systems programming without relying on high-level C functions.

# EEE3096S_LAB3
In this practical, you will switch to STM32F4, which offers greater processing power compared to STM32F0.
This practical is more open-ended (you will notice there are a few TODOs in the code compared to the previous practices) and will involve more benchmarking and comparison of performance between STM32F0 and STM32F4.
The clock has been configured to run at:
• 120Mhz for the STM32F4
• 48Mhz for the STM32F0
Since this practical is open-ended, you are welcome to change that in the ioc file, as long as you do not break the code
