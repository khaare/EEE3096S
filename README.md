In this practical, you will be using C to write code to flash all eight LEDs in a pattern based on the mode corresponding to the respective button press, which will change at an interval defined by your timer settings. You will also enable one of your push buttons to alternate the delay timing

This practical demonstrates controlling LEDs and reading pushbuttons on an STM32 microcontroller using ARM Assembly. The implementation includes incrementing LED patterns at specified intervals, adjusting the increment and delay based on button inputs, setting a fixed LED pattern, and freezing the display. The tasks emphasize low-level hardware interfacing, use of time delay loops, and conditional branching in Assembly. The practical showcases direct manipulation of GPIO and highlights core skills in embedded systems programming without relying on high-level C functions.
